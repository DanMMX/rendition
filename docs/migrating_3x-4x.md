# Migrating from v3.x to v4.x

Version 4 of Rendition includes some breaking changes. This document aims to
list these changes and provide a migration path for users wanting to upgrade.

## Dependency updates

The following dependencies have been updated to their latest versions:

options object.

trigger | 'hover' &#124; 'click' | The event used to display the tooltip, defaults to 'hover'
placement | 'top' &#124; 'right' &#124; 'bottom' &#124; 'left' | The position that the tooltip should be displayed
